# Svelte Routing POC

This is an investigation of Svelte routing strategies using [svelte-routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing).

To investigate:

-   store flight selection in localstorage
-   use auro-hyperlink with links
-   transitions between pages
-   accessibility + focus management
-   call server endpoint
-   do I need to worry about holding onto an old version of the script?
-   IE11 -- prevent from caching fetch requests
-   check recipes-mvp for store/promise examples
-   try server-side implementation?
-   query params
-   track which day the guest selected
-   highlight selected flight
-   put API call on server
-   announce flight selected
