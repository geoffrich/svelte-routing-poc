# Svelte Routing POC

This is an investigation of Svelte routing strategies using [svelte-routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing).

To investigate:

-   use auro-hyperlink with links
-   accessibility + focus management
-   do I need to worry about holding onto an old version of the script?
-   IE11 -- prevent from caching fetch requests
-   try server-side implementation?
-   query params
-   put API call on server
-   announce flight selected
-   should days be tabs?
