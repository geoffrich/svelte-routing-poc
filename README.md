# Svelte Routing POC

This is an investigation of Svelte routing strategies using [svelte-routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing).

To investigate:

-   make API call on page
-   use auro-hyperlink with links
-   storing flight selection
-   make sure data is consistent on refreshes
-   transitions between pages
-   loading indication
-   accessibility + focus management
